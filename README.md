# Breakout

This is a classic computer game created by me in educational
purposes in C ++ and OpenGL. The main goal is to create, albeit small, but
completely finished game, and the goal was achieved.
At the moment, the game is completely ready.

The following techniques were used in the program
   - Modern OpenGL
   - 2D Renderer
   - Particle generator
   - Sound processing
   - Text processing in Russian (unicode)
   - Post-processing textures
   - Collision handling
